#  Talent Working Performance (Return on Work ROW) Prediction using AI Model

This repository contains an AI model trained on a **dataset comprising 30,000 rows of data** and the **accuracy more than 92%**. The model is designed to **predict talent performance and the Return on Work rate based on multiple factors**, including fit to company rate, and total years of work experience. The primary goal of this project is to **forecast the benefits from a company perspective if we hiri the talent**.


**AI-Powered Talent Dashboard**

The AI model embedded in the InnoTalent Engine processes talent resumes and extracts essential information such as performance metrics, job role specifics, and years of experience.

## Data Relationship
### Performance - Working years - fit to company rate
![Data1](https://github.com/LeeChongKeat/Work_Performance_Prediction/blob/main/Image/Performance_Working_Rating.png)

Based on the visualization of the data, total working years do not have a strong correlation with talent performance. On the contrary, the more a talent fits the company (rating more high), the more value they can bring to the company (ROW), and the better their performance will be.
